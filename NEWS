Version 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file documents the changes between versions.  It is different from the
ChangeLog, in that changes are summarized and grouped by version.

Major Changes in 3.0.0:

- GNU Autoconf and Automake

- Switch to listening for connections, rather than initiating them.

- Implement metric collection as a plugin, along with the new plugins used
  for management.

- Allow plugins to add recurring tasks as 'jobs'.

- Dependency on OpenSSL, libXML2, and cURL.

Minor Changes:

- None worth mentioning, hence the major version change.

Some comments:

The loggeragent is beginning anew, and there are going to be problems.  Please
bear with us.
