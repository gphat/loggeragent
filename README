Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extensive documentation is included with the Loggerithim distribution, not with
this package.

Building and Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Run configure.  You must specify a directory containing certificate files
(agent.crt, agent.key, and CA.crt).  These should be present on a machine
where Loggerithim was installed.  It is also advised that you use
--enable-static to build static binaries, so that your monitored machines
do not need special libraries installed.  You probably also want to add
--enable-metrics so that the metric plugin will be built.

So your configure line should be something like:
./configure --enable-static --enable-metrics \
--with-cert-directory=/usr/local/loggerithim/certificates

1. Run "make"

2. Run "make install" or "make package".  The latter will create an RPM or
Solaris pkg (depending on what OS you run it on) that you can install on the
machines you will be monitoring.  "make install" is only for a local install,
and is really only for testing.
